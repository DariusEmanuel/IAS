## Steps to Get the App Working

### 1. Navigate to the Application Folder
Move into the folder containing the application:
```bash
cd IAS_UAV_extended
```

### 2. Use Node.js Version 20 or Higher
Ensure you are using Node.js version 20 or higher. You can do this with **nvm** (Node Version Manager):
```bash
nvm use 20
```
If you donâ€™t have Node.js version 20 installed, you can install it using:
```bash
nvm install 20
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
Install all necessary dependencies for the application:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to launch the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the Application in Your Browser
Once the development server is running, it will provide you with a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to access the application.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure you have **npm** and **nvm** properly set up on your system before running the commands.
